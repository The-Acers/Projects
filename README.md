# ðŸš€ Welcome to the **ACE Projects Repository** ðŸŽ‰

This repository is a collaborative space where members of **The ACE** community can showcase their projects, no matter how big or small. Every contribution reflects creativity, learning, and the spirit of innovation that defines our community.

## ðŸ“‚ Structure
Each project will have its own directory under the `projects/` folder. Hereâ€™s the structure:
```
projects/
  â””â”€â”€ your-project-name/
      â”œâ”€â”€ README.md (project description)
      â”œâ”€â”€ src/ (source code)
      â””â”€â”€ assets/ (images, media, etc.)
```
